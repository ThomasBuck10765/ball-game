# Ball Game

Basic ball game built in React 18 using TypeScript 4. This is currently being hosted in Azure [here](https://ball-game.azurewebsites.net/).

You play as the white ball, your goal is to collect as many green and blue balls as possible, while avoiding the red balls.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Uses [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store the high scores.

Makes use of the [naughty-words-js](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/naughty-words-js) npm package.
